Plant disease detection system is a project for identifying 11 catagory of the diseases of the tomato plant. 
Pytorch is used to suppor the structure of the project. The project includes the grayscalling the images and feeding 
into the cnn architecture that extract the features, scale down the image and after repeate process then feed to the neural network 
that computes the necessary bias and weights this as sigmod function is used to find the probability of the each class thus picking the class with the maximum 
probability.
